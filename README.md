# Electron Tutorial

## Project Setup

## App Module

This is what handles the life cycle of the app.

## BrowserWindow

This is what it handles the windows of the app, meaning the rendering of the pages that we create.

## Preload

The preload its a process to access to the Node functionality.
This needs to be accessed before the app has rendered

## Renderer

The renderer allows us to manipulate all the Front End of our app having access to the same API's than the web browser
